The aim of the game is to get rid of the tiles by using the arrow keys to switch between tiles, and clicking to eliminate tiles with the same base number.
It uses law of indices to subtract the powers, and you can press space to square root a tile, so that it's base is identical to the tile next to it
You can only eliminate the tile that is one to the right, you can't eliminate tiles that are 1 up or 1 down, or even 1 to the left
If there are blank spaces and you can't make any moves, tiles will be redrawn, and if there are no blank spaces and you can't make any moves, it's game over.
